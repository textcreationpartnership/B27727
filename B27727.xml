            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>LEst thou shouldst think thy self impertinent in reading, or me in giving thee this occasion of it, know that the first Sermon thou meetest with here; on <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 15. was preached in a course of the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lecture (that Ambulatory and savory City-Break-fast) and the Lord gave me therein an accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, with some Reverend Brethren, beyond my desert or expectation; so that I was desired to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish that Sermon. But it being too short to come forth alone, and not having the opportunity (as I was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired) to inlarge it (my larger notes on that Scripture being not at hand) I did at the request of many, joyn the second Sermon, and so the third on <hi>Jer.</hi> 50. This Scripture God had put much upon my heart in the beginning of the last Winter, and when I was far from my study and usual helps, he taught me thence with a strong hand upon my bed some truths, which seemed to my self, and many, very seasonable. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed some things for the quieting of our spirits in waiting upon God, proved so seasonable (when I saw soon after that horrid and unchristian insurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">

               </gap>; and they are as a cordial or drachme of the bottle to keep the true Christians from fainting or falling in the day of their greatest tryal. The danger that in that dark and gloomy day threatens the true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Church, is from a Three fold prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple and party; as we we may read in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:199104:4"/> the 13. and 14. verses just before the Text. There are three unclean spirits out of the mouth of the Dragon, beast and false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet engaging all to the uttermost against the people and interest of God; and all these are under one head, and in one ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvous in the verse following the Text. Now be it so that we are not just upon this <note place="margin">Called <hi>Arma Ged<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi>
               </note> poynt of time, (for in judging that we would not be positive) yet what caution and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial is high enough for the greatest conflict and danger, will sufficiently answer that which awaite's us in our times, whatsoever it may prove. Wherefore this Scripture may (as seasonable) deserve our considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that it may have it, we should know what these 3. parties are those w<seg rend="sup">ch</seg> in favour of <hi>Babylon</hi> (when her <hi>Euphrates</hi> or strength is dryed up,) do raise so great a power against those that have with drawn themselves from, and set themselves against this <hi>Babylon</hi> (that is to be destroyed. If then you will take a view of the several standards under which this Antichristian force march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth against the followers of Christ; you will see the first spirit <hi>coming out of the mouth of the Dragon,</hi> that is, having the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and commission from the Dragon, by which I understand a violent, profane, irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:199104:4"/> party acting by persecution after the manner of Heathen <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Devil manifestly reigning then and there; for in this book of Revelation we have the Devil and his Servant the Pagan Emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> presented to us under the notion of the Dragon, <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. 3.</p>
            <p>The 2d. spirit <hi>come's out of the mouth of the Beast,</hi> by which I understand a super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious Idolatrous party, I mean Idolatry against the second Commandement in the meanes of worship, as the former Heathen <hi>Rome</hi> was in the object of worship against the first Commandement. This Beast must needs be popish <hi>Rome,</hi> for <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 1, 2. it hath the 7. heads, and ten ruling hornes, and the Dragon gives him his power and seat and great authority, and who but the Pope hath the Dragons seat?</p>
            <p>The 3d. spirit is out of the <hi>mouth of the false Prophet,</hi> by which I understand an Heretical sly party, which though they have hornes like a Lamb, and so seem an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite party to the Dragon, yet <hi>speak like a Dragon, Rev.</hi> 13. 11. they do the Pope's work, as he doth Satans.</p>
            <p>Now when a spirit of prophaness and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, a spirit of superstition, a spirit of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Doctrine do severally and joyntly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mass
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:199104:5"/> and engage the powers of the world against the power of godliness, then is this watch-word given before the battel, <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed is he that watcheth and keepeth his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, lest he walk and they see his shame.</hi> In which words you have a Duty pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, <note place="margin">

The Duty is propounded in it's name <hi>watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi> and in it's aim, <hi>keepeth his garments.</hi> The Duty is perswaded by the gain if it be done, <hi>blessed is he,</hi> and by the losse if neglected, <hi>lest he walk naked and they see his shame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the whole we may learn,</p>
            <p>Christ hath care of his people in the worst of times. If men do not care what <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label> become's of them, or theirs, yet Christ take's care and make's provision for their safety; he gives out warning before he will speak out all their danger; before he brings all the enemy into one field, to a general must<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, he provide's his servants armour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he will let the blow fall on them. And if Christ in the Prophecy provides for them so long before, will he not much more make good provision and care in the time of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, the nick of their necessity?</p>
            <p>The keeping us safe and sound in terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>2</label> and tempting times, is a singular Duty
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:199104:5"/> and mercy. <hi>Blessed is he,</hi> not they, as the rest of the world are a multitude <hi>they see his shame;</hi> there is one striving and all the world spectators It is a singular duty, the end of each Christian in particular, to stand upon his guard and look to himself in such times, though he see many others altering and faltering; yea, though he see Cedars fall, he must not despond and fall under their ruine as though he were made only to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the way, opinion and fate of leading men; this is no discharge from, but an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing of his watch. And if all your watch and keeping prosper through the Keeper of <hi>Isral,</hi> you are under singular favour and blessing; admire him, not thy self, and pitty others.</p>
            <p>In the most dangerous times it is possible <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>3</label> for a Christian to be in a good condition. When all the world is about the ears of a Christian, yet he may be a very blessed man. When we see violent prophanesse, filthy superstition, and rotten doctrine, very active and stirring, we are ready to think well of the condition of other Christians, in other places or times, and cry out of our own misery as <hi>Isa.</hi> 24. 16, <hi>From the uttermost parts have we heard songs, even glory to the righteous,</hi> they have some thing to joy
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:199104:6"/> and glory in, <hi>but I said my leanness, my leanness woe unte me.</hi> I am in a poor and miserable case to fall into such times, <hi>for the treacherous dealers have dealt treacher. ously:</hi> why, is that any new or strange thing? yes, for never the like heard of, the <hi>treacherous dealers have dealt very treacher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, Fear and the pit and the snare are upon the inhabitants of the earth.</hi> The fear of the Dragon, or persecutor, the pit of the Beast or Idolater, the snare of the false Prophet or deceiver. But Christian let not thy heart be overwhelmed in such times, if now or ever thou thinkest thou seest them, for as it followes in the 18. verse, <hi>he that fleeth from the noise of the fear,</hi> he that is over solicitous to decline the dint of persecution, <hi>shall fall into the pit,</hi> will bemire himself with the carnal Religion of the Idolater, <hi>and he that cometh out of the midst of the pit,</hi> may be <hi>taken in the snare.</hi> He that hath so deadly a feare, and is so scared from popish Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, may fall into the snare of unsound do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and silly delusions.</p>
            <p>But Christian remember, that this fear, pit and snare, are only upon the inhabitants of the earth, them that have but an earthly Religion, earthly aimes, earthly conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but not upon the Inhabitants of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:199104:6"/> Heaven, they that converse there, and aime that way. Be the times bad, very bad, yet is not God good, yea very good, and very <note place="margin">Psal. 73. 1.</note> good to <hi>Israel?</hi> Yea, he may be best of all to you in the worst times; if mens doings are bad so that they do all things ill, yet Gods doings are good, and he doth all things well; if mens words are nought, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <note place="margin">Mark 7. 37</note> nought, yet Gods Word is good, as good as ever, nay, may be better of more gust and sweetnesse then ever. And as God and his Word may be now very good to <hi>Israel,</hi> to thee if an <hi>Israelite,</hi> so may thy heart be good when the times are bad, and thy heart may be a clean heart when all the world is defiled. Wherefore if we be not blessed, if things go not well with us in the main, in times we call and did, and do, make, and continue evil, let us blame our selves and our own hearts, let us fault them rather, then the times, they may be proving and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. If you believe, &amp; resent this that they may be in a good condition in bad times you will ask the question how may it be, and you will have answer in the next Doctrine.</p>
            <p>His condition is good in bad times that <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>4</label> keepeth his garments. For the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this, know what is a Christian's gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and what to keep it.</p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:199104:7"/>
            <p> A Christians garment is Christ believed and professed, Gal. 3. <hi>If any man be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized into Christ,</hi> be really united to his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son as well as bearing his name, be a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian inwardly and in heart and spirit, <hi>he hath put on Christ,</hi> Ro. 13. <hi>Put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh to fulfill the lusts</hi> (though you may the necessity) <hi>thereof.</hi> Christ is a garment too rich for the Devils scullion. Christ is as a garment to a Christian, 1 as he hide's naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in justification, 2. as he adorne's in san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctificat on, 3 as he defends against violence of seasons in redemption, and 4 as there is some answerablenesse between him and a Christian, in all the lineaments of hisl Soul and life.</p>
            <p>To keep this garment is not for a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an to lay it up in a chest, but to keep it close about him, to wrap himself warm in Christ, to use Christ for his covering, orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, defence and pattern in terrible and tempting times. Wrap your self in and keep close to Christ as he is your King, and so he will secure you from the Dragon and Beast, the prophane persecuting and the superstitious party, for they would have command of a Christians life and worship, but this belongs to Christ as a King. Keep
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:199104:7"/> to Christ as your Priest against the Beast or Idolater, that you may admit of no other sacrifice, Altar, Incense, merit or intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any in Heaven, of one rank or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Hold fast to Christ as your Prophet, that you may be kept from the Beast and false Prophet, who would put other Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and Traditions upon you then you have received from Christ?</p>
            <p>That a Christian may in trying times keep <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>5</label> his garment (hold close to Christ) he must keep special and close watch. If he keep not his watch, he cannot his garment. Watching is a duty of general concernment for all Christians and times, but in trying times a Christian must double his watch, must look out sharp, must be specially intent. See the reason, nature, and Use of this watch.</p>
            <p>Because of Christ's terrible manifestation <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason </seg>1</label> of himself against them that are secure; <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I come as a thief</hi> that is, suddainly and to spoil, and therefore to affright. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever come's on a secure and unexpecting person come's suddainly, and if a friend come so, he may startle us, much more if at midnight when you are in deep sleep; a Thief comes with a light in one hand, and in the other a naked sword or cockt pistol to your bed side, and so wakens you, and this
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:199104:8"/> frightful sight is the first that your opened eyes meet with, this will be very ghastly; and so will Christs suddain appearing be to all those that in such trying times are secure, careless, and look not, and prepare not for his coming.</p>
            <p>Because of the special blessing that is <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason </seg>2</label> upon thē, which are on their special watch, in such trying times. The blessing is sure because pronounced by Christs own mouth, and there never was nor can be found guile in his mouth. They that will by no means let go their garment though the Dragon, Beast, and false Prophet, pull hard at it, will haply, be censured and cursed, as those that are a froward, waspish, cross-grained, intractable, and unsatisfiable sort of men, that marr all good designes; but Christ blesseth them, yea, and they shall be bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. It may be those that are easy yeelding men, and will be content to change their garment, turn their coate, may have the applause &amp; blessing of flattering silly men, yea, and may bless themselves and count themselves happy, but they loose the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of Christ.</p>
            <p>The shameful discovery of him that neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason </seg>3</label> his special watch in such times; <hi>Lest he walk naked and they see his shame.</hi> His <hi>naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:199104:8"/> may be the filthinesse of his nature, and his <hi>walking naked,</hi> his having his course and conversation stained with his corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; his corrupt nature breakes forth in enormous and foul courses; he appears to be a Cowardly, Covetous, Ambitious, False, Sensual, or silly Creature, like any other of the Children of Wrath. And the shame of this discovery is that it will be observed in him by many others, and improved to the dishonour and scorn of himself and his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession; they see his shame, the Devil and his Children that watched for this, will tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph when they find it, and say, Look you now, what is become of all this man's great Profession, and his blessed Reformation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold he is become as one of us; for thus they will blame &amp; scorne that in him which they have wisht and perswaded him to.</p>
            <p>Thus having seen the Reasons of special watching, let us enquire into</p>
            <p>The nature of this watch.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To watch is to keep from sleep, or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, and carelesnesse, and to be exercis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a holy fear and care, 1 Thess. 5. <hi>Let us not sleep as do others, but let us watch.</hi> It is to look about us that no evil of sin, or suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering may surprize us, and take us (as we say) napping. If we cast off a holy fear and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:199104:9"/> awe of God, so as to venture on any thing (as hath been our manner in late times) we can not perfect holiness, or happiness.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To watch is to avoid the causes of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, all opiate or sleepy dulling occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions; this is called Sobriety by? <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Thess. 5. 6. <hi>Let us watch and be sober,</hi> and this sobriety is twice coupled with watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the Apostle <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 4. 7. and 5. 8. and it is opened by their</p>
            <p>Lord, <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 34. <hi>Take heed to your selves lest at any time,</hi> no one time is allowed to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity or that which breeds it, your watch may never be discharged, much less in our dayes, (which are the last dayes, to which Christ speake's here as well as in our Text) may ye be slack in your guard, lest in any one day or hour <hi>your hearts be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged,</hi> or made heavy (as most translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons render) <hi>with surfeiting and drunkenness, and cares of this life,</hi> if your hearts be very at ent to, and intent on, this bodily and worldly life: they will be too inattentive and remiss, to your spiritual life; if earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things fall with a great weight upon your hearts, they will not also stand under the weight of your Heavenly Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and <hi>so that day,</hi> the day of Christs powerful and glorious manifestation <hi>come</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:199104:9"/>
               <hi>upon you unawares,</hi> or (as the French translation) suddainly surprize you, <hi>Watch ye therefore and pray allwayes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. To watch is to have your eye open to Gods eye and Gods hand; To his eye, see that he seeth you and all your matters, and <note place="margin">Exod. 14. 24, 25.</note> one look of that eye of his into the host of the most confident and formidable <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> hath troubled their host, and taken off their Charriot-wheels that they drave them heavily. Look also on Gods hād, his doings, for it is fit that the eye of the servant should <note place="margin">Psal. 123. 2</note> be to the hand, to the least becks and moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Master. And it is good for you to observe well what God is doing in the world, for he doth often cast down and build up again, but those that <hi>do not regard,</hi> do not seriously and faithfully improve <hi>the</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 28. 9.</note>
               <hi>works of the Lord, nor the operations of his hands, he shall destroy them and not build them up.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. To eye Sathan, and see what he is do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for he goes his rounds to espy advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages to attaque you, and therefore your guards within must go their rounds to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend; if he be undermining in one place, and you are watching and digging in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, what hinders but that he will spring his mine, and make his breach and entry?
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:199104:10"/> Watch therefore this watchfull enemy, and see in what part of Doctrine, Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or Worship he is about to supplant you; He drew one of the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> to an <note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.</note> incestuous and scandalous match, and made it with him and the Church a very light matter; but when by the faithful watchman the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> he was defeated in this design, he rallies his force and skill present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a contrary enterprize, and designe's the Church into an excesse of rigour, and the offender into despair; And he had car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it, had not the same Apostle watched and discovered his stratagem. Wherefore look about on every side, that you may see <note place="margin">2 Co. 2. 11.</note> where your restless enemy makes his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches.</p>
            <p n="5">5. To watch, is to eye your own heart with it's inletts and outletts, and see what evil it is a doing or like to do. For your heart within hath too much correspondence with that enemy without, and hath but too much of his Image: For is Satan the <hi>old Serpent that deceiveth the world?</hi> so is your heart <hi>deceitful above all things;</hi> is Sata<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">

               <hi>that wicked one?</hi> so is your heart <hi>desperat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wicked.</hi> And how dare ye shut your eyes sleep and be secure, having so wicked a de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceiver lodged within doores? Look daily
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:199104:10"/> hourly, into the shop, and see what forgery is about there, what evil thought, affection, device, fashionable to the present evil world is upon the anvil; thy heart will be continually forging some evill or other, as ensnaring fear of Men, Envy, Grudging, <note place="margin">Psalm 73.</note> and Impatient Fretting at their Prosperity, frivolous spending of your time and Spirit in speaking evil of them, without those ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ends of Gods glory and your own or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Edification; Murmuring at Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence as too harsh, or at your Brethren, as more guilty and causall of present and feared evills; questioning the necessity of continuall strictnesse. Watch your heart in any of these its it's extravagancies, and catch it in the manner; for any of these or any other evil word or work makes you as dry wood, as a dry and combustible Tree in <note place="margin">Lu. 23. 31.</note> evill dayes, the dayes of the kindling of Gods wrath, as innocence and care in these and other common corruptions renders you as a green, living Tree, on which the fire takes not so easie hold.</p>
            <p n="6">6. To watch, is to eye your duty, and see what good you should be doing. You must watch unto prayer, 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 4. 7. and so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to instruction, prov. 8. 34. <hi>Blessed is the man</hi> (saith wisdom) <hi>that heareth me,</hi> not stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling

That such fruit may be brought forth in its season, <hi>Psalm</hi> 1. And the special fruit or duty in such a time is towards God to acknowledge him, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards brethren to help them, towards o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to convince them; but if in one word or Scripture you would know the duty of Christians in a time when <hi>Babylons</hi> ruine, and the true Churches deliverance are in hand, read them in <hi>Jer.</hi> 50. 4, 5. <hi>In those dayes, and in that time, saith the Lord, the Children of Israel shall come, they and the Children of Judah together, going, and weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: they shall go and seek the Lord their God. They shall ask the way to Zion with their faces thither ward, saying, Come, and let us joyn our selves to the Lord in a perpetual Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant that shall not be forgotten.</hi>
            </p>

            <p n="7">7.

You will be adventuring (as <hi>Eve)</hi> without a due fear of your selves, without sufficient Warrant from God, and without the use of such helps God hath provided, without these you will parley with the Serpent, and the just consequence of that rash Confidence and daring Presumption of yours, will be that the <hi>Serpent will beguile you through his subtility, so that your mind will be corrupted from the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity that is in Christ.</hi> To fortifie you against this mischief, <hi>this spirit of Devils that come's out of the mouth of the false Prophet.</hi>

            <p>You must keep close to Christ, not only as your prophet, but your ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Prophet in the Gospel, Gal. 1. 8. <hi>If we</hi> who are Apostles so miraculously call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and countenanced from Heaven, and the Pope pretend's but to succeed one of them, and other false Teachers can sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly but pretend to be like them, but if <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> himself, or any other Apostle, <hi>or an Angel from Heaven,</hi> or any Angel ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing as an Angel of Light, or any man of high and heavenly holiness, and power

And think not you, these last times to be priviledged from such dangers, when the Dragon and Beast are stirring, watch against them and the false Prophet also, for he will be doing his part, and complying (its likely) in doctrine, and by degrees in worship, and we see in our day of tryall that men

            <p>HEre is a Prophetical Description of of Gods people in the Stature, Complexion and Feature they should
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:199104:17"/> grow to, relating to a certain time; of which time, and the Description relating to it, we must consider a little, that we may be edifyed by the Text.</p>
            <p>The time and dayes wherein the people of God shall attain to the Complexion described, you may know by the three first Verses of the Chapter, which shew:</p>
            <p n="1">1. This Word, or Sermon of <hi>Jeremy</hi> from the Lord to be against <hi>Babylon,</hi> Verse 1.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The necessity of preaching, or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing it's destruction, and this is in the beginning of the second Verse, <hi>Declare ye among the Nations,</hi> and though it might be no pleasing, and so no safe matter to preach of, now <hi>Babylon</hi> was in such pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>yet publish and conceal not, Babylon is taken.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Babylons</hi> ruine is amplified,</p>
            <p n="1">1. By the vain help of her greater I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols <hi>(Bel, Merodach)</hi> as well as her lesser, And,</p>
            <p n="2">2. By the Instrument, <hi>out of the North there cometh a Nation against her,</hi> Vers. 3.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The degree of <hi>Babels</hi> ruine, it is an ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter destruction, that northen Nation <hi>shall make her land</hi> not only the City <hi>desolate,</hi> &amp; <hi>none shal dwell therein, they shall remove,</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:199104:17"/>
               <hi>they shall depart, both Man and Beast.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These are the dayes, and this the time wherein Gods people (called the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Judah)</hi> must be of such a Complexion as the Text gives a draught of; Yet for our improvement of the Text in these last dayes, it will be further enquired, whether it remaines only as a Doctrine to teach us some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable truth, or as a prophecy which is not fully answered. The latter I close with, that is, This Prophecy, though it were in some degree answered, yet was it not accomplished to the uttermost, in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving the <hi>Babylonish</hi> Monarchy, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary to which, was the Jewes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their own Land. The reasons of this perswasion are,</p>
            <p n="1">1. When this time is full, and this Prophecy is evacuated, the City of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> because of the wrath of the Lord, <hi>shall not be inhabited, but it shall be wholly desolate, every one that goeth by Babylon, shall be astonished and hiss at thy plagues,</hi> Verse 13. <hi>As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and the neighbour Cities there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, saith the Lord, so shall no man abide there, neither shall any Son of Man dwell there,</hi> Verse 40. So in the next Chapter,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:199104:18"/> which is part of this Prophecy, <hi>Verse</hi> 8. <hi>Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed,</hi> Verse 37. <hi>Babylon shall become heaps, a dwelling place for Dragons, an astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and an hissing without an inhabitant.</hi> And the Land of <hi>Chaldea</hi> (whereof <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> is the Mother-City) <hi>shall be made desolate, atd none shall dwell therein, they shall remove, they shall depart both Man and Beast,</hi> Verse 3. before the Text.</p>
            <p>But this Desolation of the City and Country, was not executed at the dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the <hi>Babylonish</hi> Monarchy, for long after this City flourished in the <hi>Persian</hi> Monarchy, and the <hi>Greek</hi> Monarchy, (whose first Monarch <hi>Alexander</hi> died there) and in the time of the <hi>Roman</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, when indeed it suffered decay by the Neighbourhood of <hi>Seleucia,</hi> of which <hi>Strabo</hi> (who in <hi>Tiberius</hi> time) saith it is greater then <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Babylon</hi>

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:199104:18"/> that the ancient <hi>Babylon</hi> is destroyed, and a new one near to it, called by the same name, or <hi>Baldach;</hi> but this is but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, and being granted, answers not this Prophecy, for that Country or Land of <hi>Chaldea,</hi> is hereby supposed to be well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited, and this City the Metropolis of <hi>Chaldea</hi> but a little removed; if indeed it be removed, for <hi>Otto Frisingensis</hi> saith, the present <hi>Baldach</hi> or <hi>Babylon,</hi> is part of old <hi>Babylon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2.

This reality and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticalnesse of Christians, is their walking up to their principles and profession.

            <p>Having thus taken a general prospect of the Text, and so a view of the frame and temper of Gods people in the time of <hi>Babel's</hi> utter desolation, and their own through recovery therefrom, let us make some use of the whole. I would make four uses of it.</p>

            <p>1. <hi>Reas.</hi> Gods people must further this ruine of <hi>Babylon</hi> by effectual prayer, and their prayer that it may be made ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual requires their union. That pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is that blast of the Rams horn, is the great battery which must cast down the walls and strength of <hi>Babylon,</hi> it appears in this prophecy of <hi>Jeremy</hi> against <hi>Babylon,</hi> where we find the people of God effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally at this employment, <hi>Jer.</hi> 51. 35, 36, 37. <hi>The violence done to me, and to my flesh, be upon Babylon, shall the inhabitant of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on say, and my blood upon the Inhabitants of Chaldea, shall Jerusalem say.</hi> It seemes then that <hi>Babylon,</hi> is not such an Enemy as must be prayed for, but such as may and must be prayed against; for here we have Gods people praying for a return and revenge of all their <hi>violencies</hi> or abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and all <hi>their blood</hi> or slaughters upon the City and Country of <hi>Babylon:</hi> If you say, how shall we know that his prayer

Read your satisfaction in that which followes; <hi>Therefore thus saith Jehovah, behold I will plead thy cause, and take vengeance for thee, and I will dry up her sea, and make her springs dry, and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon shall become heaps.</hi> The same thing is signified, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. 6. <hi>The seven Angels came out of the Temple, having the seven Plagues,</hi> 16. 1. <hi>And I heard a great voice out of the Temple, saying, to the seven An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels go your wayes, and pour out the vialls of the wrath of God.</hi> In the Temple or Church of God are bred and obteined the plagues or gradual destruction of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> and the commission (as one might say) for the executing of them.

When <hi>God riseth up,</hi> or is stirring, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as before he seemed to sit still, and not to have any mind <hi>to the prey,</hi> he makes the union of his people as the cause of the cause, <hi>for he will turn to the people a pure Language,</hi> instead of that confounded and divided one, <hi>that they may all call upon the name of the Lord, to serve him with one consent.</hi> This proves both parts of this first Reason, for it makes prayer necessary for the ruine of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, and union of his people necessary for that prayer, else one will pray for one thing, and another for another; and when they can not, and will not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand one another, God will not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand one or other, till they are all agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that with one Lip they can <hi>all,</hi> not some, <hi>call upon the Lord,</hi> he will not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to them; he will return them back and say, you must agree in your prayers, before I will agree to your prayers.

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:199104:66"/> worldly interest is but an outward slight tye, a string that will not hold. You are by it but an artificial member, and belonging to another body, belonging to the world, and so, as the borrowed member of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther body, can not be made to survive it, but will rot and perish with it, though the body (to which you were so artificially fastened) do yet live. Being unconverted you cleave to Gods people as the drosse to the gold; the gold passeth through the fire unconsumed, but leaves the dross there. If you would have one heart with Gods people, you must have a new spirit, for the old spirit will not, cannot kindly fall in. <hi>I will give them,</hi> saith the Lord, <hi>one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you.</hi>

            <p>2. <hi>Ʋse.</hi> To instruct Christians unto a patient accepting of the tryals and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, that do or may befall them, for these afflictions may make for our Union, and our Union for the Churches greatest mercies, and <hi>Babylon's</hi> final overthrow. Affliction is rather to be chosen then sin, affliction and mutual love, rather then prosperity and mutual enmity. It is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that the Fathers rod should come and make peace, and hush all the contentions and brawles of his Children, then that in the absence of the Rod, they should make so unhandsome a noise, and so scandalous a dinn, throwing the house out of the windows. Our Lord joyns his Command of Brotherly-love, with his predictions of <note place="margin">John 15. 17. 18</note> the worlds hatred; and indeed the worlds hate of you, and that upon one common score, (because they first hate Christ) should and doth ingage to mutual love; if the wicked world can espie something of
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:199104:67"/> Christ in you all to hate and despise, can not you find something of Christ in you all to love and tender? Therefore when <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Aliquid Christi</hi> Melancth.</note> Christians are in danger to fall in with the wicked world, and fall out one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it is better they should have the world frown on them, then flatter and dandle them. It is as true as usual a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison, when the sheep are careless and wandring far from one another, it is the love and care of the shepheard to bring them together by his dog.</p>
            <p>When brotherly-love growes cold, it doth (as the frost) unite heterogenous things (things of another kind) they love all a like, as well one as another, they are making a medley with the world, and so drowning their proper interests &amp; lustre, yet they are not <hi>of the world, but Christ hath chosen them out of the world;</hi> and <note place="margin">Joh. 15. 19</note> therefore the world can never heartily love them, though it can so dissemble it's hate, as to deceive them into a belief of it's love. Now there is need of a <hi>fiery tryall,</hi> the tryal by fire distinguisheth the gold frō the <note place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 12.</note> dross &amp; unites the gold; this fire brings a thaw, this heat segregates heterogenous things, and aggregates homogeneous, now every one will go to his kind, like will to like. And this discrimination and union is worth a great deal of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:199104:68"/> When the children are wrangling, and not like children, but like cats &amp; dogs, snarling, scratching and biting one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, now it is good that the Father should come and correct them; for it will draw out &amp; manifest their brotherly-love, that was buried before by unbrotherly carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age; Now Christians can pity and help one another, now they can pray for, and with one another; Now they can search and pry rather into their graces then their infirmities And whē we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ee brotherly love, or the manifestatiō of it, the effect of their chastening, we know that Fatherly-love is the cause of it; and in very love and <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 6. Ps. 119. 75</note> faithfulnesse doth our Father chasten us, that we may be received of him, and of one another.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Ʋse</hi> is an exhortation to Christians, to mind union one with another, as ever you mind and look for the deliverance of the Church, and downfall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>gn of Christ, that you divide from <hi>Babylon,</hi> that you may not be destroyed with her, and unite together among your selves, that you may be saved together▪ But Satan's design is to mingle you with <hi>Babylon,</hi> that you may be destroyed with her, and divide you among your selves, that you may be consumed by your selves. If you will unite you will
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:199104:68"/>
               <hi>work with God,</hi> and shall work <hi>great sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in Israel.</hi> If you will still divide, <note place="margin">1 Sam. 14. 45.</note> you will be cross to Christ, as Antichrist, and do Satans work. It hath been, and is Antichrists great business in our genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to divide Protestants one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in publick quarrels, <hi>England</hi> from <hi>Holland; Holland, Brandenburgh,</hi> and <hi>Denmark</hi> from <hi>Sweden;</hi> and now to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to an accommodation with one part (the <hi>Lutherans)</hi> that they may, and till they do, utterly destroy the other. And as haply this busie Pope, by his Emissaries <note place="margin">De propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gandâ fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de.</note> of the new named Inquisition, doth unite the Popish states, &amp; divide the Protestant; so by the same hands it is thought he doth make and cherish private differences in, both <hi>Englands</hi> as well as elsewhere; that Protestants being weary of their distracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and breaches, some part, (it may) be the greater, may fall in with the Roman Catholick Church, who boasts in unity, &amp; bywracks &amp; gibbets forceth to it. And will you (Christians) by your divisions, grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie Antichrist to your destruction, rather then obey and gratifie Christ to your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance? Antichrist knowes what he doth in dividing you, for so he keepes off his own ruine; but you know not what you do in dividing your selves, you keep off your own deliverance. If you be resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:199104:69"/> you will not agree, Christ is resolved he will not deliver, neither is it as hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, reasonable he should. Wherefore be not only willing to peace offered, but search for it, and eagerly follow it when it withdrawes; and this you must do if ever you will <hi>see good dayes,</hi> you must <hi>es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chew</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Peter 3. 10, 11.</note>
               <hi>evil, and do good, you must seek peace and ensue it,</hi> or <note n="(a)" place="margin">Some Greek Copies.</note> make peace, <note n="(b)" place="margin">Fr. Ital.</note> or search for peace and follow it, with the same eagernesse, as persecutors do good Christians, you must hunt as some <note n="(c)" place="margin">Syr. Arab.</note> read, run after it. This readiness for peace will appear,</p>
            <p n="1">1. If Gods receiving any man be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for yours, and enough against a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny different opinion; <hi>Let not him that eateth, despise him that eateth not</hi> (as too nice) <hi>and let not him which eateth not,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 14. 3.</note>
               <hi>despise him that eateth,</hi> as too loose, <hi>for God hath received him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. If you will on occasion, as well exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise indulgence to another, as expect it frō him. You will else be like that wicked ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, who when he needed forbearance, pleaded for it; <hi>Have patience withme, and I will pay thee all,</hi> but whē his fellow need<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">Mat. 18. 26</note> the sāe, &amp; used the very sāe plea, he wil notyield. And observe this, that the party of you that will be more sturdy &amp; unyielding, and more backward to receive peaceable
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:199104:69"/> advise, is likely to be the more faulty and guilty party. Moses <hi>shewed himself</hi> to two Israelites <hi>as they strove, and would have set thē at one again, saying, Sirs, ye are brethrē,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 7. 26. 27.</note>
               <hi>Why do ye wrong one to another. But he that did his Neighbour wrong, thrust him away, saying, who made thee a Ruler and a Judge over us?</hi> And this surly behaviour to <hi>Moses,</hi> whom God designed to be their deliverer, put back their deliverance 40. years. If the <hi>Israelites</hi> will not make peace one with another, they shall yet many a year make bricks for the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> If they will not endure <hi>Moses,</hi> as a gentle and righteous umpire, they shall indure yet a while <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> a severe and unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous tyrant.</p>
            <p>And further, to perswade you to peace and union, you may consider, it is for your safety, which was shewed of old by <hi>Silurus,</hi> to his sons in a bundle of arrows, which could not be broken while so united, but being severed, were easily snapt asunder. And in Philosophy it is known that all corruptiō is from division; every thing subsists while it continues one. Wine is more able to resist the air and all corruption, when it is kept toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>But yet further to inforce this, if you Christians will not unite one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:199104:70"/> with whom will ye? God hath put barrs of everlasting enmity between you <note place="margin">Gen. 3:</note> and the seed of the Serpent. And what God hath separated, let no man attempt to joyn. It cannot be, you are of another spirit, another generation. Whatsoever you count of one another, the world counts you all but odd people; and an odd number with an even, can not make an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven number, two odd numbers joyned, may make an even number. Wherefore should you court the world, or the worldly Church that is <hi>Babylon?</hi> If you retein your integrity, you can not heartily entertain one another. And bethink your selves, whether the Lord Christ will not take it ill at your hands, that you should be so stiff &amp; unyeilding to your brethren that follow Christ, and yet can be any thing supple to <hi>Baal,</hi> you can go to the utmost of your line in complyance with Antichrist. But how can I have a more full or proper argument for the union of Gods people, then what is lodged in the Text, as it was spread in the former dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course? How can you without this Union go any of those steps there mentioned to meet the Lord Jesus when he comes as a Bridegrome to refresh his Church, and destoy the great Whore? Christ then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects you should be in a holy and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:199104:70"/> communion; but that is not possible without the Union we have now spoken to. <hi>Can two walk together except they be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Am. 3. 3.</note> Christ will have you then in a weeping, that is, repenting praying frame; but what repenting if you do not confess and forsake this great iniquity of your contention; and what prayer can you pray <hi>without doubting,</hi> if you <hi>lift</hi> not <hi>up</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 8.</note>
               <hi>holy hands without strife.</hi> And for building <hi>Sion;</hi> divided, confounded tongues are more likely to build <hi>Babylon.</hi> So for the spiritual use of Ordinances, or the seeking the Lord and joyning your selves to him; If you can not embrace and cleave to thē that are begotten, how shall you indeed joyn your selves to him that begetteth? Likewise for your obedient practicall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, <note place="margin">1 John 5. 1</note> you must needes be far from it, when you can be content to live in the neglect of so great a command of Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly-love and peace, which Christ hath so frequently enjoyned, and so earnestly urged. Lastly, for fixednesse in Gods ways, it is not probable you should grow to it, while you are divided: for divisions do make men willing to embrace new occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of withdrawing fro those that they are alienated from, and also those that are estranged from others, will fasten, &amp; even force upon them new errours which
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:199104:71"/> were never dreamt of before.</p>
            <p>But what speak I of any good dayes and blessed times here, for which this U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Christians is necessary? It is certain the blessednesse of true Christians is in the coming of Christ, and then all of them must be gathered together unto him. <hi>Now we beseech you by the coming of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, and by our gathering together unto him</hi>

               <note place="margin">1 Thes. 4. 16, 17.</note>
               <hi>with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air, and so shall we ever be with the Lord.</hi> Christians, you are the nearer Heavenly complete Glory, and perpetual presence of Christ, the more you are knit together in Spirit and Interest.</p>
